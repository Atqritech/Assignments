  <p>  Dear Peter <br> </p>
    
    <h3> Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568) </h3>
    
I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br> Trade Me on 14 February 2013. <br>
<br>
    
    I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the <br>
    position, including: <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
     <li>time management and strong organisational skills </li>
    <li> high-level customer service and friendly relationship management </li> 
    
<li> cash handling and sales ability </li> 
<li> motivation and dedication <br> </li> </ul>
    
    As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer <br>
     service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The <br> Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail <br> career. <br>
    <br>

    I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use <br>
    my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview. <br>
    <br>
    
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you. <br>
    <br>

    Yours sincerely <br>
    <br>
    
    Lizzie Long
